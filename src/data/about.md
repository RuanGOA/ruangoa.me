# About Me

Hey there! 👋 

Come hang out for a minute, and I'll tell you a little about me.

I was born in the late 90s in a smaller city in Pernambuco, Brazil. When I first got a computer, I spent a lot of time online – playing games, reading random stuff, the usual. Soon enough, everyone started calling me "the computer guy" – you know, the one who helps install programs and fix printers when they act up.

When it was time for high school, my parents suggested a special school that mixed regular high school with learning about computers (Informatics). That was my first real taste of coding and tech, and guess what? I loved it! After finishing, I knew I wanted to learn even more, so going to a Federal University for Computer Science seemed like the right thing to do.

University was great – I learned so much, just like I hoped. I also got to work on some really important projects, which gave me good hands-on experience, and I met some super smart people. After the five years were up, I felt ready to get a job in the tech world. But then, plot twist! I decided to go for a Master's degree instead.

And that brings us to this blog! This is actually the third time I'm trying to create from scratch and populate a blog (maybe it'll stick this time?). I want to run away from tutorials or "propagate" technologies, because I think the web has enough of this type of content. I really just wanted a place to write down ideas before I forget them. Maybe someone else will find them interesting too! I also want to write about some of the projects I'm working on in my free time. I am inspiring myself with some contents in [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), [The New Yorker Open Questions](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/open-questions) and [Augusto Galego](https://www.youtube.com/@GutoMonologos) parallel content, which I freely share for the content quanlity.

If you want get in touch, you can reach me by the links at the [contact](/contact) page.

Thank you for the attention, SYL!

## So, what am I up to right now?

Besides school stuff, I'm currently:

- 🏃 Training to run a half marathon in October! Wish me luck :)
- 💪 Going to the gym and trying out different kinds of workouts
- 📚 Reading articles to prepare the thesis for my Master's degree
