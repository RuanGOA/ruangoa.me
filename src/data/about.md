# About Me

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ 

Come hang out for a minute, and I'll tell you a little about me.

I was born in the late 90s in a smaller city in Pernambuco, Brazil. When I first got a computer, I spent a lot of time online, playing games, reading random stuff, the usual. Soon enough, everyone started calling me "the computer guy", you know, the one who helps install programs and fix printers when they act up.

When it was time for high school, my parents suggested a special school that mixed regular high school with learning about computers (Informatics). That was my first real taste of coding and tech, and guess what? I loved it! After finishing, I knew I wanted to learn even more, so going to a Federal University for Computer Science seemed like the right thing to do.

University was great, I learned so much, just like I hoped. I also got to work on some really important projects, which gave me good hands-on experience, and I met some super smart people. After the five years were up, I felt ready to get a job in the tech world. But then, plot twist! I decided to go for a Master's degree instead.

And that brings us to this blog! This is actually the third time I'm trying to create from scratch and populate a blog (maybe it'll stick this time?). I want to run away from tutorials or "propagate" technologies, because I think the web has enough of this type of content. I really just wanted a place to write down ideas before I forget them. Maybe someone else will find them interesting too! I also want to write about some of the projects I'm working on in my free time. I am inspiring myself with some [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) posts, [The New Yorker: Open Questions](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/open-questions) and [Augusto Galego's](https://www.youtube.com/@GutoMonologos) parallel youtube channel, which I freely share for the quality.

If you want get in touch, you can reach me by the links at the [contact](/contact) page.

Thank you for the attention, SYL!
